# Automated UI Test Framework for The Uplifter's Website

Tom Earwaker (The Uplifter) is my favourite DJ that's not Jimbo. I thought I would have a go at testing his website's UI for fun, as it's a very aesthetically pleasing site with plenty of musical nuggets.

## Tools and Technologies
- Ruby
- Selenium Webdriver
- Capybara DSL
- Gherkin

## OOP Approach
I have implemented a page object model, comprising of a site module and several pages of the website as classes modelled in Ruby.

## Priority Use Cases
1. A user should be able to listen to Tom's music from the homepage
2. A user should be able to purchase Tom's music in fewer than five clicks
3. A user should be able to navigate to Ents24 to purchase tickets for his next performance
4. A user should be able to view information about his next performance
5. A user should be able to purchase physical merchandise in fewer than five clicks
