# Automated UI Test Framework for The Uplifter's Website

Tom Earwaker (The Uplifter) is my favourite DJ. I thought I would have a go at testing his website's UI for fun, as it's a very aesthetically pleasing site with plenty of musical nuggets.

## Tools and Technologies
- Ruby
- Selenium Webdriver
- Capybara DSL

## OOP Approach
I have implemented a page object model, comprising of a site module and several pages of the website as classes modelled in Ruby.

## Priority Use Cases
1. A user should be able to listen to Tom's music from the homepage
